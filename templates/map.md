### Power Output Map

Last Updated: {{ update_time }}

This map shows the power output of individual plants connected to the transmission grid as stated in their most recent Physical Notifications. This data can be retrieved through the *PHYBMDATA* BMRS stream, the out-turn data can be viewed one week later through the *B1610* stream. The scrollbar at the top of the map can be used to view how the generation sources have changed their output over the last week, the layer control can be used to toggle on/off the transmission network, and the plants themselves can be clicked to reveal additional information. The plant location data used in this map has been taking from a sister project, [the Power Station Dictionary](https://osuked.github.io/Power-Station-Dictionary/), which aims to link between data about individual power plants.
